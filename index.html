        Hi all, my name is Christopher Jones, I'm from the UK. I began my journey into coding around April 28th 2022, so it is safe to assume I'm new to the game. However, I have always liked design, so frontend will always come first. Don't get me wrong, I love the things that, Java, sql has to offer, and I hope to become a full stack developer one day, but for now, I'm taking my journey slow and steady.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the coming weeks. I'll be focusing on HTML and CSS until I'm confident with layouts, selectors, indentation and so on...
